        <li>¼ cup red wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons hot water, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container low-fat ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Slice zucchini lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with salt; set aside to drain in a colander.</li>
        <li>To prepare the meat sauce, cook ground beef and black pepper in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add green pepper and onion; cook and stir until meat is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine, basil, and oregano; add a small amount of hot water if sauce is too thick. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir ricotta, egg, and parsley together in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>To assemble lasagna, spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared pan. Layer with 1/2 of the zucchini slices, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, all of the spinach, followed by all of the mushrooms, then 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat by layering in the remaining meat sauce, zucchini slices, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella. Spread Parmesan evenly over the top; cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil; raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
